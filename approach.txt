File Name:- Car Park

App.js----> Parking.js -------> Details.js and ParkingSpace.js  <The Components tree>


Approach:-

1. A main App component is calling the parking space which is divided into two spaces first is the registration space and second is the space where the cars would be parked. 

2. In the registration space, a person would enter the details and it would be stored in their local storage <Working>

3. The data stored in the local storage should be extracted in the form of a dictionary object <Not working>

4. Therefore I have created a make shift dictionary object which has key- registration number and color.

5. To give an example of the query, I used that dictionary object and iterated it using filter and map functions to display registration numbers, according to the color selected from the dropdown.

Elements Used:-

->Modular approach.
->Use of hooks like:- useState and useEffect
->Bootstrap functionality for a shorter code
